## 🚀 Adventures in Tech (aka My Projects)

### 🔌 **The Great IT Setup**
Ever set up an entire network for a company? I did that. For a real estate firm, I connected their main office and branches across cities, supporting 25+ computers. It was basically the tech equivalent of being an architect, but for the internet.

### 💻 **Random Cool Things on GitHub**
Explore my repositories to find:
- Front-end projects that look slick 🎨
- Back-end magic that makes everything tick 🧙‍♂️
- A few experiments that didn’t blow up (mostly).
